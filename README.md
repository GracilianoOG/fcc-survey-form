# 💻 Survey Form | FreeCodeCamp

## 📖 Description

This is my final solution for the *Survey Form* certification project at [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), made with HTML, CSS and optionally made with *SASS/SCSS* since I want to practice with it. It is inspired by the Half-Life series I absolutely love.

The sent solution to FreeCodeCamp is way simpler, I wanted to spicy it up a little bit and train a little with SASS, I have played a little with some colors I totally haven't stolen from [CrowbarCollective](https://www.crowbarcollective.com) because I have found them very nice.
